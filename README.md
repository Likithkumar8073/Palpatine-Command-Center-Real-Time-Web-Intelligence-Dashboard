# 🛰️ Project Palpatine: Intelligent Web Log Analytics using Splunk Enterprise

> “Behavior is predictable. The Force reveals all.” — *Team Palpatine*

## 🧠 Overview

**Project Palpatine** is an advanced web log analytics and visualization system built using **Splunk Enterprise**.  
Our goal was to mine over **3.5GB of web server logs** to extract insights related to **system performance, user behavior, traffic patterns, and security anomalies**.

Using complex SPL (Search Processing Language) queries, we engineered **interactive dashboards, anomaly detection models, and geo-visual reports** that reveal deep insights from massive log data in real time.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Processed **3.5GB+ of Apache web server logs** across multiple nodes.
- Designed and implemented **3 interactive Splunk dashboards** for performance, security, and behavior analytics.
- Built advanced **SPL-based queries** for detecting:
  - DDoS attacks & suspicious login patterns  
  - System failures & 500+ server errors  
  - User session patterns & bounce rate analysis  
  - Geographic traffic visualization and OS distribution and
  - +10 more anamolies
- Developed a **data ingestion pipeline** to handle large log datasets by splitting, indexing, and merging data efficiently.
- Applied **data transformation and field extraction** to normalize inconsistent log formats.
